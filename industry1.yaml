    Aborigines of the Americas and Australia used fire to retool the landscape
    favorable for elk, deer, bear, and kangaroo. This ecological management
    changed dry forests into savannas and is the leading theory on what caused
    the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions.

    Reliable littoral food supplies in the Pacific Northwest, Japanese Jōmon,
    and Ecuadorian Valdivia allowed high population densities and refined
    cultures despite being hunter-gatherers. Fishing technology included dugout

    Points hafted with pyrotechnic pitch and birch bark glues seems to require
    visualization of a range of different pre-processed parts, and so may have
    been the first technology.

    This tool remained unchanged for the vast majority of human existence,
    although it does no seem to be any better for scraping, cutting, or
    butchering than the flakes produced alongside it. It may have been used in
    sexual selection or as a commodity.

    Percussion firemaking produces high temperature sparks by striking iron
    pyrite or marcasite against flint. Ötzi the Iceman used a tinder fungus
    that, if hammered flat, turns into something like felt that smolders for
    hours, allowing fire transport.
