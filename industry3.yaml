    Sails have used to propel ships since the navigation of the Nile in ancient
    Egypt. On land, the first known horizontal-axis windmills were used to
    grind cereals.

    Early smelters, in which impurities in iron ore were pounded out followed
    by a quench in cold water, were a state secret of the Indo-European
    Hittites. Their monopoly of cheap iron weapons made them a superpower.

    Chinese blast furnaces produced cast iron, which was then either converted
    into finished implements in a cupola furnace, or turned into wrought iron
    in a fining hearth. The engineer Du Shi improved the design with a
    waterwheel and piston-bellows providing the air blast.

    Iron smelting was independently discovered in Nigeria's vanished Nok
    culture, which skipped the Bronze Age to combine iron, stone age tools,
    agriculture, and unique terracotta sculptures. The ploughshare caused a
    population explosion when introduced into Europe.
