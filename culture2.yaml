    The burial of the dead as if they were still living is ubiquitous in the
    archaeological record. Dead leaders were bizarrely provided food, tools,
    and weapons. Perhaps the hallucinated commands of the dead king were
    necessary for an ancient society to function.

    Forest cleared by slash and burn is farmed until its fertility drops, and
    then left fallow long enough for the forest to return. This is called Dredd
    in India, Ladang in Indonesia, Milpa in Mesoamerica and Jhumming in North
    East India.

    The agricultural Hurrians of northern Mesopotamia were master ceramists,
    and their wheel-made Khabur and Nuzi pottery was highly valued as far
    afield as the Egyptian New Kingdom.

    Although there are many wild pig species, only Sus scrofa has been
    domesticated. DNA studies show two domestication events, one in Middle East
    and another in China, and both by hunter-gatherers.

    wheel was then replaced by a flywheel, allowing centrifugal force to mass
    produce pots.

    The strange human habit to willingly breathe smoke likely originated with
    the shamanic use of cannabis, opium, or tobacco. The hallucinations may
    have been the first imaginings and its persistence today reflects the
    appeal of ancient modes of decision-making.

    The competitive re-enactment of reality emphasizing skills of abstraction
    in a framework of rules may have been the bridge to the social
    understanding of written maps and definitions.
